Hello,

Here is my HW4, choosing the "Heroes of Pymoli" path. 

Please note, two of my tables don't show up well when looking at github but display properly when opened in Jupyter Notebook. 
Please let me know if there are any suggestions to clean up those tables, as well as formatting to currency/two decimals as 
there were some struggles with that as well.

Thanks!
